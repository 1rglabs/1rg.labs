The digital agency they originally engaged in building the portal is no longer in business, and NFFTT has been struggling with addressing platform stability and usability issues."},
    {"type": "text", "content": "Along with user experience, the platform did not provide access to reliable operational data, limiting staff’s ability to set policies and evaluate the health of the organization."

  "impact": [
    {"type": "text", "content": "NFFTT saw a major increase in volunteer signups during the pandemic, and a major concern at the end of the 2022 season was to give  everyone who signed up the opportunity to participate in picks."},
    {"type": "text", "content": "The team was evaluating different membership models when we launched a deep dive in their historical data. After our initial investigations, we built a micro-product which visualizes volunteer activity on a map. "},
    {"type": "text", "content": "This work unlocked information that pointed the team to focus on outreach and recruiting new tree owners rather than changing their membership model."}
